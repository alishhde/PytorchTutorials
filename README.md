# Pytorch Tutorials
------------------------------------------------------------------
- In this repository you can learn about Pytorch along me by my organised notebooks.
- Although My notebooks are mainly based on what [Pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/) official taught, `I have added more information to notebooks based on my experience and research to cover the tutorials lackness and provide you a complete understanding about pytorch and the tools it presents you.`
- Those who have no idea about Artificial Inteligence's topics (e.g. who have no idea about what Neural Networks is) do not need to be worry. I'll make sure that anything mentions here will mention from basic thought to provide the required knowledge to understand the implementation and that topic.

# What is Pytorch ?
------------------------------------------------------------------
PyTorch is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella. It is free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.
